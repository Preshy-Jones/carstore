        A used car can cost considerably less than when it was new. That’s
        because you’re not paying taxes and charges that are applied to brand
        new cars. There are other factors that cause a car to lose value as it
        gets older (known as depreciation) which means there are some real
        bargains to be found. You won’t miss out on any tech because many used
        cars have features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity,
        and driver safety systems such as adaptive cruise control. There’s also
        a huge variety of used cars to choose from whatever size or shape of car
        you want, and whatever sort of power you want it to have, including
        electric.

        Everyone uses their car differently. Some people drive very few miles,
        some drive a lot. And that’s reflected in the mileage you’ll see on used
        cars. The average annual mileage in the UK is around 12,000 miles per
        year. If the used car you’re interested in has covered less than that,
        you can consider that good (or low) mileage. But don’t dismiss cars that
        have done higher mileage. Cars are designed to cover hundreds of
        thousands of miles and, so long as it’s been serviced regularly, a car
        with high mileage should be no less reliable than one with lower miles.

        You have the right to return anything you buy that turns out to be
        defective or not what it was advertised to be, within a certain
        timeframe. You might think that just applies to new stuff, but it’s also
        true of anything you buy used from a registered trader (or dealer),
        including cars. You can find out more about the returns policy at Cazoo
        here.

        Used car dealers aren’t legally required to provide warranty cover, but
        many do. Used cars are still covered by the manufacturer's warranty they
        came with, and this gives you between three and seven years of cover,
        depending on the manufacturer. Warranty coverage provided by used car
        dealers varies but most provide around 90 days (three months) of
        coverage.

      <p className="mt-4">
        Many companies, and car dealers, also offer – at extra cost – an
        extended warranty that can protect you against the cost of unexpected
        repairs your car might need. You can find out more about CazooCover
        extended warranty here.
