        <p>
          A used car could be the perfect choice for your next car. Used cars
          can give you great value for money, along with a huge range of models
          to choose from, and they’re available to buy immediately – no need to
          add your name to a waiting list. You also have several options for
          paying, so you can choose the one that suits you.

          How do I choose the right used car for me?
        </h3>
        <p>
          With so many great cars to choose from, a good place to begin
          narrowing down your options is to consider how you’ll actually use
          your car. A small hatchback is ideal if you mostly do short trips into
          town, while a large SUV will be great if you go on a lot of family
          holiday road trips. Think about how big a car you need, taking into
          account the size of your driveway and how many friends and family
          members you might need to fit inside. Consider how many miles you
          typically drive, and what sort of fuel you want to use – petrol
          engines are great if you do lots of shorter journeys, while a diesel
          engine may make sense if you cover a lot more miles. If you want
          minimum running costs and a lower environmental impact, an electric
          car might be a great choice, or if you want something that’s in
          between, a hybrid or plug-in hybrid could be just what you need.

        How can I pay for my used car?
      </h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        When it comes to paying for your Cazoo car there are a number of options
        available, all of which are easy to do and entirely online. You can buy
        a car outright, pay using a credit or debit card or apply for finance.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        You can also choose to
        <strong className="text-primaryMain">
          part exchange your current car
        </strong>
        and the price will be deducted from the cost of your Cazoo car. If your
        current car has outstanding finance on a PCP or HP agreement, we’ll
        still take it off your hands. Simply use Cazoo's
        <strong className="text-primaryMain">car valuation calculator</strong>
        to see how much your car is worth.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        You can also finance a used car from Cazoo, either through
        <strong className="text-primaryMain">Hire Purchase (HP)</strong> or
        through a
        <strong className="text-primaryMain">
          Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)
        </strong>
        . HP lets you spread the cost of the car over monthly payments, with no
        limits on how many miles you can drive. At the end of the agreed term,
        you own your car. HP could be right for you if you know you want to keep
        the car at the end of the agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        With PCP, your monthly payments tend to be lower than with HP because
        you agree to your anticipated monthly mileage and won’t become owner of
        the car unless you make a final ‘balloon’ payment. PCP is a good choice
        if you like to change your car every few years or if you aren’t yet sure
        you want to own the car at the end of the contract.

        entering a few details and we’ll give you an instant valuation. This is
